# The project running live: https://react-films-appi.netlify.app/

# APP repository: https://github.com/RafaRJimenez/movies-api

# To install the project:

# Run "npm install" in the root of the project

# Run "npm run dev" to open the project locally 

# I used 4 hooks (useEffect, useState, useRef, useCallback), custom hooks, props and debounce to build the project

# The project is responsive, although I have not dwelled much on styles for lack on time
